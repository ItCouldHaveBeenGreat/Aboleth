## How to Run
1. Run regression.py

## Notes
1. Had to change the entry for 'Orc Eye of Gruumsh' because the attack used 'dice' instead of 'damage'.
2. Derived the data from the 5etools website  (https://github.com/ariestae/5etools), which contains a data directory with a set of bestiaries (which were combined into one big file for simplicity).
3. Everything in the monster_data_utilities below the line is deprecated and being migrated to five_e_tools wrapper.
4. harvest_monster_data is deprecated and pending deletion (but  it has cool stuff in it?)
